Financial Loan Prediction and Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing financial loan data and developing predictive models to classify loan statuses. It incorporates Python-based data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning for prediction, as well as a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key insights.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 38,576 rows and 14 columns covering various financial and demographic features:

Integer Columns:
id: Unique identifier for each loan record.
member_id: Identifier for the loan applicant.
annual_income: Applicant's annual income.
dti: Debt-to-income ratio.
installment: Monthly installment amount.
int_rate: Interest rate for the loan.
loan_amount: Total loan amount applied for.
total_acc: Total number of credit accounts.
total_payment: Total payment made on the loan.
Categorical Columns:
address_state: State of residence of the applicant.
application_type: Type of loan application (individual or joint).
emp_length: Length of employment in years.
grade: Overall grade of the loan.
home_ownership: Home ownership status of the applicant.
issue_date: Date the loan was issued.
last_credit_pull_date: Most recent credit report pull date.
last_payment_date: Date of the last payment made.
loan_status: Loan status (target variable for prediction).
next_payment_date: Date of the next payment due.
purpose: Purpose of the loan.
sub_grade: Subgrade of the loan.
term: Loan term duration.
verification_status: Income and asset verification status.
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Addressed missing values using imputation techniques.
Handled outliers to ensure data consistency.
Transformed categorical variables using encoding techniques for machine learning compatibility.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified trends and patterns in loan statuses.
Visualized relationships between loan features and target variable (loan_status).
Conducted correlation analysis to identify significant predictors.
3. Feature Importance
Using feature importance techniques, the following features were identified as most influential in predicting loan status:

emp_title: Applicant's job title.
dti: Debt-to-income ratio.
annual_income: Applicant's annual income.
loan_amount: Loan amount applied for.
int_rate: Loan's interest rate.
sub_grade: Subgrade of the loan.
4. Model Training
Machine learning models were trained and evaluated using the processed dataset:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was selected for deployment.

5. Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present key insights, including:

Loan status distribution.
Feature importance rankings.
Model performance metrics.
Trends in loan issuance and repayment.
